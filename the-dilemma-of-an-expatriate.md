# The Dilemma of An Expatriate Writer

One choice I often have to face when writing is what language to use. The obvious answer is Chinese, my mother tongue ("Tongue" is still a hard word for me after all these years: I rely on the spell checker to assure my spelling is correct. Also, I have never quite got the handle of prouncing the "g" sound). The argument against it is, I read a lot more English now. My thoughts are constructed in English. Why do I have to translate my thoughts to another language, even though it's the language of almost all my thoughts from the past?

I don't have to make similar choices as a programmer. If I am working alone I would either use an unfamiliar language that I have long wanted to toy with, or the language I am best at. If I work in a pack, it would be a silent, unanimous vote: the language most members are comfortable with. 

Picking the right language for writing is a difficult thing: it draws boundaries around certain thoughts, which can only be articulated in the shunned language. With exclusive usage of either language, my writing would have to forsake some of my throughts, or I have to uproot these thoughts and deliberately translate for myself.
