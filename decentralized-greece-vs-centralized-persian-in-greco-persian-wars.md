Greece in 500 B.C. is a perfect example of decentralized political and economic system: small states with their own governing bodies, from Athen's radical democracy to Sparta's two-king oligarchy. Separated by rigged mountains, naturally it is much harder for a hegemony to emerge and unite the city-states (but as history has proved it is doable). 
Persia, on the other hand, embodies a model of centralized authority, able to collect its taxes, amass military resources across a vast geographical domain, either directly or through its agents. 

Why did Persia fail to conquer the continental Greek city-states? Certainly the reasons are many-layered. But are there reasons involving *intrinsitc* characteristics of a centralized political/economic system vs. a decentralized one?

Some dimensions I can think of to measure a political body's degree of centralization:
* taxation: who is the ultimate recipient of collected taxes and who decides how to spend them
* military organization: how drafting/ranking works; who makes critical military decisions
* an average citizen's choice: an average citizen's impact on an important decision
